## Carlos's HTML5 Boilerplate

Based on the awesome HTML5 boilerplate, this repo includes typical changes and additions that I usually make. One main differene is that third-party files (aside from HTML5 Boilerplate itself) is treated as Bower dependency. 

### Using index.html

Yes, I suppose you could use this for static HTML, but how often does that happen anymore? Regardless this can be the starting point for your _layout.mustache, _layout.twig, _layout.nunjucks, _layout.html, _layout.... ok you get the picture.

### LESS is more

You should be using LESS, so this will hopefully encourage you. I have compiled the main.less into a main.css so you can get up and running if you don't use LESS, but really you should (or SASS, but these files are LESS specific).

### About the Bower dependencies

I've decided to include them in the repo in the event that the user might not be familiar with using Bower. I had no idea about how to use it not too long ago, and figure a lot of people might be in that situation. Besides, I want this to be a clone-and-go resource.
